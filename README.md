# ZapShirts
This is an idea I have to make t-shirts that are also bitcoin point-of-sale terminals. 


## Create T-Shirt Point-Of-Sale
The idea is to create a bitcoin point of sale on a T-shirt. You can use it to sell stickers at a conference or have a friend pay you back for dinner. It is only limited by your imagination.

### Why Would Anybody Need A ZapShirt?

I no longer "orange pill" local businesses. I do not care if they wish to accept bitcoin, but I want to be the change in the world I want to see. I will accept bitcoin on a T-Shirt to show others how easy it is to accept bitcoin as a p2p electronic cash system. Anyone can accept bitcoin as payment if they want to. You could print a sign on a piece of paper if you wanted to. The problem was, nobody I asked wanted a sign, even bitcoiners. So I asked myself...Self, what if you did the opposite? What if the customer accepted bitcoin, but the business owner did not.

I also thought it would be pretty cool T-Shirt to wear at meet-ups.

### How To Make Your Own Zap Shirt
1. Create a QR code that sends you to your coinos page, getalby page, strike or whatever you feel comfortable using. This can easily be done at https://libreqr.com/
2. Use a program like [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) to replace the default QR Code with your own QR code on the file.
3. Create the shirt.
